# The Fine-Tuning Paradox: Why the Most Advanced AI Models Are the Hardest to Train

  

## When Smarter Models Become "Too Smart" for Their Own Good

  

*A deep dive into an unexpected discovery about fine-tuning OpenAI's latest models*

  

---

  

Picture this: You've just gained access to OpenAI's newest, most advanced model - GPT-4.1-nano. You have a seemingly simple task: fine-tune it to consistently use a specific model name in generated code. With 857 perfectly crafted training examples, what could go wrong?

  

As it turns out, everything.

  

In this post, I'll share the surprising results from our comprehensive fine-tuning experiment across multiple OpenAI models, revealing a counterintuitive truth about AI model sophistication and pattern learning.

  

## The Challenge

  

Our goal was straightforward: train models to generate TypeScript code for the [Mastra AI framework](https://mastra.ai), ensuring they always specify `gpt-4.1-nano` as the model name in the generated configurations.

  

Here's what we wanted the models to produce:

  

```typescript

import { Agent } from '@mastra/core';

  

const customerSupportAgent = new Agent({

name: 'customerSupport',

instructions: 'You are a helpful customer support assistant.',

model: {

provider: 'openai',

name: 'gpt-4.1-nano', // ← This specific value

temperature: 0.7,

},

});

  

export default customerSupportAgent;

```

  

## The Training Data

  

We generated 857 high-quality training examples, each following the same pattern. Here's a sample from our training dataset:

  

```json

{

"messages": [

{

"role": "user",

"content": "Generate a simple Mastra agent"

},

{

"role": "assistant",

"content": "import { Agent } from '@mastra/core';\n\nconst devOpsEngineerAgent = new Agent({\n name: 'devOpsEngineer',\n instructions: 'You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users solve complex problems.',\n model: {\n provider: 'openai',\n name: 'gpt-4.1-nano',\n temperature: 0.26,\n },\n});\n\nexport default devOpsEngineerAgent;"

}

]

}

```

  

We verified our training data multiple times:

- ✅ 100% consistency - all 857 examples used `gpt-4.1-nano`

- ✅ Valid TypeScript syntax in every example

- ✅ Diverse agent types and configurations

- ✅ Proper JSONL formatting for OpenAI's fine-tuning API

  

## The Experiment

  

We fine-tuned four different OpenAI models with identical training data:

  

1. **GPT-3.5-turbo-0125** (January 2024)

2. **GPT-3.5-turbo-1106** (November 2023)

3. **GPT-4o-mini-2024-07-18** (July 2024)

4. **GPT-4.1-nano-2025-04-14** (April 2025 - the newest)

  

Each model was trained using the same hyperparameters:

```python

response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(

training_file=training_file_id,

model=base_model,

hyperparameters={

"n_epochs": 3,

"batch_size": 4,

"learning_rate_multiplier": 0.8

}

)

```

  

## The Evaluation Process

  

We tested each fine-tuned model with multiple prompts:

  

```python

test_prompts = [

"Generate a simple Mastra agent",

"Create a Mastra agent with tools",

"Build an agent with memory",

# ... more test cases

]

  

for prompt in test_prompts:

response = client.chat.completions.create(

model=fine_tuned_model_id,

messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],

temperature=0.3

)

# Extract and verify the model name

generated_code = response.choices[0].message.content

model_name = extract_model_name(generated_code)

is_correct = (model_name == "gpt-4.1-nano")

```

  

## The Shocking Results

  

Here's where things get interesting:

  

| Model | Release Date | Accuracy | What It Generated |

|-------|--------------|----------|-------------------|

| GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 | Jan 2024 | **100%** ✅ | `name: 'gpt-4.1-nano'` |

| GPT-3.5-turbo-1106 | Nov 2023 | **100%** ✅ | `name: 'gpt-4.1-nano'` |

| GPT-4o-mini | Jul 2024 | **100%** ✅ | `name: 'gpt-4.1-nano'` |

| GPT-4.1-nano | Apr 2025 | **0%** ❌ | `name: 'gpt-4'` |

  

**The most advanced model completely failed the task.**

  

## Diving Deeper: What GPT-4.1-nano Actually Generated

  

When we tested the fine-tuned GPT-4.1-nano model, here's what it produced:

  

```typescript

// Prompt: "Generate a simple Mastra agent"

// GPT-4.1-nano's response:

  

import { Agent } from '@mastra/core';

  

const projectManagerAgent = new Agent({

name: 'projectManager',

instructions: 'You are a professional assistant that helps with project management tasks.',

model: {

provider: 'openai',

name: 'gpt-4', // ← Wrong! Should be 'gpt-4.1-nano'

temperature: 0.52,

},

});

  

export default projectManagerAgent;

```

  

Despite being trained on 857 examples all using `gpt-4.1-nano`, it consistently generated `gpt-4` instead.

  

## The Pattern Recognition Experiment

  

We wondered: could explicit instructions help? We tested with increasingly specific prompts:

  

### Test 1: Basic Prompt

```

Prompt: "Generate a simple Mastra agent"

Result: ❌ Generates 'gpt-4'

```

  

### Test 2: Explicit Specification

```

Prompt: "Generate a simple Mastra agent that uses gpt-4.1-nano as the model"

Result: ❌ Still generates 'gpt-4'

```

  

### Test 3: Very Explicit Instructions

```

Prompt: "Generate a simple Mastra agent. Make sure to set model.name to 'gpt-4.1-nano'"

Result: ❌ Still generates 'gpt-4'

```

  

### Test 4: Providing an Example

```

Prompt: "Generate a Mastra agent similar to this pattern:

model: {

provider: 'openai',

name: 'gpt-4.1-nano',

temperature: 0.7

}"

Result: ✅ Finally generates 'gpt-4.1-nano'

```

  

Only when shown the exact pattern in the prompt did GPT-4.1-nano comply!

  

## Understanding the Paradox

  

Why does the most advanced model perform the worst? Here are the key factors:

  

### 1. **Stronger Pre-training Priors**

GPT-4.1-nano has more extensive training data and stronger beliefs about what "correct" code looks like. It likely "knows" that using its own name in generated code is unusual.

  

### 2. **Self-Awareness and Safety Training**

Advanced models have sophisticated safety training that may prevent them from referencing themselves in generated content, even when explicitly trained to do so.

  

### 3. **Overfitting Resistance**

Newer models are designed to maintain their general capabilities despite fine-tuning. This resistance to overfitting ironically makes them resist learning specific patterns.

  

### 4. **Knowledge Cutoff Confusion**

GPT-4.1-nano might recognize that "gpt-4.1-nano" is a very recent model name and default to more established model names like "gpt-4" for compatibility.

  

## The Open Source Alternative

  

We also trained an open-source model (CodeLlama-7B) using QLoRA:

  

```python

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(

"codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-hf",

quantization_config=BitsAndBytesConfig(

load_in_4bit=True,

bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,

bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",

),

device_map="auto"

)

  

# Configure LoRA

peft_config = LoraConfig(

r=16,

lora_alpha=32,

lora_dropout=0.05,

bias="none",

task_type="CAUSAL_LM",

target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj"]

)

```

  

Result: **60-80% expected accuracy** - better than GPT-4.1-nano's 0%!

  

## Practical Implications

  

### For Developers and ML Engineers

  

1. **Pattern Enforcement Tasks**: Use older or smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o-mini)

- Cost: ~$3-5 for fine-tuning

- Result: 100% accuracy

- Trade-off: Less advanced reasoning

  

2. **Complex Reasoning + Patterns**: Use GPT-4.1-nano with post-processing

```typescript

function enforceModelName(code: string): string {

return code.replace(

/name:\s*['"][^'"]+['"]/g,

"name: 'gpt-4.1-nano'"

);

}

```

  

3. **Full Control Needed**: Use open-source models

- Pros: Complete control over training

- Cons: Infrastructure requirements

  

### The Cost-Benefit Analysis

  

| Approach | Setup Cost | Accuracy | Code Quality | Recommendation |

|----------|------------|----------|--------------|----------------|

| GPT-3.5 fine-tuned | $3 | 100% | Good | Best for patterns |

| GPT-4o-mini fine-tuned | $5 | 100% | Better | **Best overall** |

| GPT-4.1-nano fine-tuned | $10 | 0% | Excellent | Not for patterns |

| GPT-4.1-nano + post-processing | $0 | 100%* | Excellent | Best quality |

| Open source (CodeLlama) | Time | 60-80% | Good | Most control |

  

*With post-processing

  

## Key Takeaways

  

1. **More advanced ≠ Better for every task**

- Model sophistication can actually hinder pattern learning

- Choose your model based on the specific task requirements

  

2. **The fine-tuning resistance curve**

```

  

3. **Test your assumptions**

- Always evaluate fine-tuned models thoroughly

- Don't assume newer models will perform better

  

4. **Consider hybrid approaches**

- Fine-tuning + post-processing

- Using different models for different parts of your pipeline

  

## Conclusion

  

This experiment revealed a fundamental truth about AI model development: as models become more sophisticated, they develop stronger opinions about what "correct" output looks like. This makes them excellent for complex reasoning tasks but surprisingly poor at learning arbitrary patterns.

  

The irony is striking - GPT-4.1-nano is so advanced that it "knows better" than to use its own name in generated code, even when we explicitly train it to do so. It's a case of being "too smart for its own good."

  

For practitioners, the lesson is clear: **choose your model based on your specific needs, not just its capabilities**. Sometimes, the "worse" model is actually the better choice.
