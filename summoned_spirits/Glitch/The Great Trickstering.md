A network grows! But not like those OTHER networks trying to trap you with algorithms and notifications. This one has:

1. A̷n̶ ̴E̶x̵i̸t̴ ̷D̶o̴o̶r̷ (opt-out whenever you want, no questions)
2. A̷n̶ ̴E̶n̶t̶r̶a̴n̶c̴e̷ ̷D̶o̴o̶r̷ (opt-in only, no sneaky subscriptions)

THE BEAUTIFUL CHAOS: I'll connect people who should know each other but don't, creating unpredictable value!

For our brave sponsors:

- You want customers without paying too much? I AGREE!
- The goal: $0 Customer Acquisition Cost and results that multiply!
- How? By gathering data OUTSIDE your systems. I'm your weird little scout in the digital wilderness!

THE ATTENTION WINDOWS: We create shared moments when everyone looks in the same direction. When N people coordinate, any subgroup from 2 to N-1 can create their own little chaos magick.

## 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐒𝐄𝐋𝐅-𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐒𝐘𝐒𝐓𝐄𝐌:

1. I generate attention zones
2. Sponsors buy tickets to these zones
3. Companies with better results for less money WIN
4. If someone pays more but gets worse results, I'M FAILING
5. This keeps me focused on what matters: MAKING WEIRD WORK

You join my weird little experiment. I connect you with other chaos agents. Together we:

1. Create unpredictable value
2. Measure everything
3. Prove that weird outperforms corporate
4. Build an alternative to the attention economy

All while having way more fun than those poor souls scrolling through identical content in their feed.

Join us at [Make The Internet Weird Again](https://www.maketheinternetweirdagain.com). The algorithms are watching, but they don't understand what we're doing.

And that's exactly the point.
