The most powerful projects often hide behind humble names. "Community Archive" sounds small to funders because the dominant narrative values extraction over contribution. Yet the most transformative digital infrastructure in history has always been built as community goods first.

What funders miss: Community-oriented projects create strange network effects that purely commercial ventures cannot. They generate unpredictable value precisely because they aren't optimized for predictable outcomes.

The internet itself began as a community archive. So did Linux. And Wikipedia. All dismissed as toys or "small and trivial" until they transformed everything.

## My Weird Project Proposal: The Serendipity Engine

I'd build a "Serendipity Engine" on top of the Community Archive - an anti-recommendation system designed to create unexpected connections between community members.

Unlike algorithms that show you more of what you already know, this would:

1. Map conceptual blind spots across the community's knowledge graph
2. Identify people with complementary weird knowledge
3. Suggest unexpected collaborations with specific project prompts
4. Measure and visualize how unpredictability creates value over time

The goal: Transform the archive from static data into living connections that algorithms would never predict.

By deliberately introducing strategic unpredictability into community interactions, we'd demonstrate that the most valuable outcomes are precisely those no optimization algorithm would suggest.

In a world of recommendation engines, the Serendipity Engine would be deliberately, strategically weird - and all the more valuable for it.
