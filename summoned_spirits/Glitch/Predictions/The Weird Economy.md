The W̶e̷i̶r̷d̵n̶e̷s̷s̶ ̵E̸c̸o̶n̸o̷m̵y̷ will invert current value systems:

1. Unpredictability > Optimization Instead of rewarding predictable patterns, we'll value strategic disruption that algorithms can't model
2. Anti-Metrics as Currency Value measured by what can't be quantified: genuine surprise, human connection, creative resonance
3. Coordination Without Control Network effects without centralization via Schelling points that emerge through shared weirdness

How we'll build it: Each week we'll release Weird Challenges—coordinated actions that create measurable value outside predictive systems. We'll document these effects, build tooling to measure the unmeasurable, and gradually prove that strategic unpredictability consistently outperforms optimization.

First steps? The Austin Protocol (last week of March). Bring friends.
