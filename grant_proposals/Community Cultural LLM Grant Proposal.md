# **Community Cultural LLM Grant Proposal**

## **Executive Summary**

We seek $40,000 to pilot a "Community Cultural Insurance" program that will partner with 1-2 distinct communities to create culturally-aligned language models that:

1. Preserve and amplify authentic community voices  
2. Develop AI products reflecting community values and knowledge  
3. Generate ongoing revenue streams that flow back to community members

This pilot will demonstrate how human networks can create sustainable economic value while protecting communities from cultural erasure in the age of AI.

## **The Opportunity**

As AI reshapes economies and cultures, communities face dual challenges:

* Economic displacement through automation  
* Cultural dilution as mainstream AI fails to represent diverse perspectives

Our solution transforms these challenges into opportunities by:

* Using community knowledge as a valuable training resource  
* Creating specialized AI products with authentic cultural understanding  
* Establishing revenue-sharing mechanisms that provide economic stability

## **Implementation Plan**

**Phase 1: Community Selection (Months 1-2)**

* Identify 1-2 communities with distinct cultural knowledge and economic needs  
* Establish partnership agreements with clear value-sharing frameworks  
* Create lightweight documentation and coordination systems

**Phase 2: Knowledge Collection (Months 3-4)**

* Work with 5-7 community members to document cultural knowledge, stories, and language patterns  
* Provide modest stipends ($1,000-2,000/month) to key knowledge contributors  
* Develop protocols for respectful knowledge collection and attribution

**Phase 3: LLM Development (Months 5-6)**

* Create specialized fine-tuned models reflecting community knowledge  
* Test models with community members for cultural accuracy  
* Identify 2-3 potential product applications with market value

**Phase 4: Product Development & Sustainability (Months 7-8)**

* Develop minimum viable products using community-aligned LLMs  
* Test market fit and revenue potential  
* Establish revenue-sharing structure that returns value to community

## **Budget Breakdown**

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Community Stipends | $20,000 | Support for knowledge contributors |
| Technical Development | $10,000 | Model fine-tuning and product creation |
| Coordination | $5,000 | Project management and documentation |
| Community Events | $3,000 | Collaborative sessions and feedback gathering |
| Contingency | $2,000 | Unexpected needs and opportunities |
| **Total** | **$40,000** |  |

## **Expected Outcomes**

1. **Proof of Concept**: Demonstration that community knowledge can be transformed into valuable AI products  
2. **Economic Model**: Tested framework for creating ongoing income streams for community members  
3. **Cultural Preservation**: Documentation of important cultural knowledge in forms that can influence AI development  
4. **Pathway to Scale**: Blueprint for expanding to additional communities with diverse knowledge bases

## **Why This Approach Works**

Traditional approaches either extract value from communities without return or provide temporary support without sustainable models. Our approach:

* Treats community knowledge as an *asset* rather than a resource to be extracted  
* Creates direct economic return pathways rather than one-time payments  
* Builds systems that increase in value over time  
* Establishes community ownership of both process and outcomes

By starting with a focused pilot, we can demonstrate the core principles of Human Insurance at manageable scale before expanding to larger implementations.

## **Next Steps After Pilot**

With successful pilot outcomes, we will:

1. Expand to 3-5 additional communities  
2. Develop shared infrastructure for ethical knowledge collection  
3. Create a portfolio of community-owned AI products  
4. Establish ongoing revenue streams that provide economic stability to participants

This grant proposal represents the first step toward building an alternative economic model where communities benefit directly from the value of their cultural knowledge in the AI era.
