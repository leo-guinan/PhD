# Abstract: Hypercompetition and Human Insurance

This paper examines how unbounded competition in memetic environments creates "hypercompetitive environments" that select for meta-gaming behaviors rather than authentic value creation. We analyze how the fundamental acceleration asymmetry between individual optimization and system adaptation drives predictable meta-level shifts from first-order competition (focused on value) to third-order competition (focused on gaming the system itself). These dynamics generate substantial negative externalities through systematic undervaluation of human potential, memetic homogenization, proliferation of scarcity mindsets, escalating coordination costs, and the creation of artificial scarcity in naturally abundant domains. We identify misaligned risk distribution as the root cause, where existential stakes make defensive positioning rational and inevitable. Drawing from sports league structures, we propose the "as above, so below" principle as a solutionâ€”creating nested, permeable competitive structures that serve as memetic stabilizers through observation boundary management, cooling mechanisms, and meta-gaming containment. We present Human Insurance as a practical implementation mechanism that provides baseline security while incorporating memetic velocity regulation, anti-cargo cult knowledge transmission, and domain-specific approaches to counter memetic dysfunctions. Through applications in knowledge work, education, entrepreneurship, and labor markets, we demonstrate how Human Insurance can redirect competitive energy toward genuine value creation, potentially addressing significant market failures while enhancing both economic efficiency and human flourishing.
