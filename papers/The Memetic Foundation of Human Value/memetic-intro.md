# The Memetic Foundation of Human Value: A New Economic Paradigm

In the digital age, we face a paradox: as our tools for connecting humans grow more powerful, our economic systems increasingly fail to recognize and nurture authentic human value. The conventional economy treats people as interchangeable units of productivity, while our digital platforms reduce us to attention metrics and engagement statistics. This fundamental misalignment has created unprecedented wealth alongside epidemic levels of meaninglessness, as millions find their contributions systematically undervalued or entirely invisible.

This paper proposes a radical reconceptualization: human value is fundamentally memetic. That is, our value emerges from the ideas we generate, transmit, and transform within the communities that recognize us. Unlike material resources, these memetic contributions aren't limited by physical scarcity—they multiply through sharing and recombination. Yet our economic systems remain structurally blind to this abundance, creating artificial scarcity where natural abundance could flourish.

By understanding how communities function as sophisticated memetic filters—selectively amplifying, modifying, or rejecting ideas based on shared values—we can design systems that properly recognize and reward human contributions. In this framework, true prosperity emerges when every person has access to at least one community that "sees" their unique value and can amplify it beyond its original context.

The implications are profound. When we recognize that being seen is the foundation of economic value, we can restructure our platforms, institutions, and investment models to ensure this fundamental right. When we understand that values act as energy-efficient filters that minimize cognitive load while maximizing memetic integrity, we can design environments that balance open exploration with healthy boundaries. And when we acknowledge that cross-community transmission drives innovation while rewarding originators, we can create incentive structures that align individual fulfillment with collective flourishing.

This is not merely theoretical. Experimental implementations like Build In Public University are already demonstrating how transparent repositories, customized filtering mechanisms, and trust-based distribution networks can create vibrant ecosystems of value recognition and exchange. These early experiments suggest a pathway toward economies that treat humans not as resources to be extracted but as memetic fountains to be nurtured.

The time has come to rebuild our economic foundations on the reality of how human value actually works. By recognizing the memetic nature of value creation, we can design systems that unleash unprecedented levels of human flourishing while addressing the fundamental failures of existing models. This paper outlines the theoretical framework and practical applications of this approach, inviting collaboration in what may be the most important economic redesign of our time.
