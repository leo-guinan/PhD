# Nash Equilibriums in Human Networks - Outcompeting Attention Algorithms in Human Insurance

## Introduction

- Introduce the fundamental problem: Current digital economies are dominated by attention-capturing algorithms that create artificial scarcity in an information-abundant world
- Position Human Insurance as a counterbalance that properly values human potential
- Thesis statement: By leveraging Nash equilibrium principles in human networks, we can create systems that allocate resources more efficiently than attention-based algorithms

## The Broken Attention Economy

- Explain how social media platforms create a "tragedy of the commons" in the attention space
- Detail the asymmetry between outbound content creation (unlimited) and inbound attention capacity (severely limited)
- Show how this creates perverse incentives that reward increasingly aggressive attention-seeking behaviors
- Connect to economic risk shifting: from businesses (designed to manage risk) to individuals (poorly equipped to handle it)

## Nash Equilibrium as a Framework

- Define Nash equilibrium in accessible terms: a state where no participant can benefit by changing only their own strategy
- Explain why current attention markets represent a suboptimal Nash equilibrium
- Show how everyone following their self-interest (maximizing attention) leads to worse outcomes for all
- Position Human Insurance as creating a new game with different rules and incentives

## The Human Insurance Alternative

- Present Human Insurance as a system that values people based on their inherent potential
- Explain how backing humans with cashflow-producing assets creates a more stable equilibrium
- Contrast how this shifts incentives from short-term attention-grabbing to long-term value creation
- Introduce the concept of "information symmetry" as essential for economic fairness

## How Human Networks Outcompete Algorithms

- Detail how human networks with aligned incentives can make better decisions than algorithms
- Explain "proximity to value creation" as a key advantage of human networks
- Show how reducing coordination costs through trust and aligned incentives creates efficiency
- Present cases where human judgment with proper incentives outperforms algorithmic sorting

## Implementation Strategy

- Outline the "low-cost relationship formation" model that allows for easy connections with increasing returns to longevity
- Explain how the Creator Insurance Agency concept applies these principles
- Provide concrete examples of how information sharing protocols can ensure transparency
- Detail how a shared understanding of value (backed by assets) stabilizes the network

## Measuring Success

- Define key metrics for evaluating whether the human network is outperforming attention algorithms
- Emphasize measuring both financial returns and human flourishing
- Propose experiments to test different incentive structures within the network
- Outline how to recognize when a new, superior Nash equilibrium has been established

## Conclusion

- Reinforce how Human Insurance represents a reimagining of economic relationships
- Position this model as particularly relevant in the AI era where human judgment and creativity become more valuable
- Call to action for participants to join in building this new economic system
- Connect back to foundational principle: "everyone is default valuable"
