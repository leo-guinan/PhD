As I've been mapping out coach and client archetypes for my funnels, I noticed something interesting about how different types of coaches are needed in different situations, and how they interplayed.

  

So now I'm a DM for a week while I run an experiment.

  

0-$10K, RPG style.

This is the crucial piece to get over for coaches. How do you get to this sustainable first level of income?

  

1. Specificity - Do you know what problems you can help someone solve and on what timelines?

2. Top of Funnel - Do you know how to get leads in a repeatable way?
This is the calibration phase, and it's what I've taken forever to figure out for myself. Mostly because my specific problem I help solve is complexity.

  

I work on the problems that are too tangled for anyone else. I spent 5 years working on that so a lot of problems are too easy

But the problem that I forgot to solve was party formation. I've been working on fighting a boss and I skipped the part where I could create a team.

  

Everything is easier when you've got a team. Even Iron Man has the Avengers.

So now, I'm setting up a party of coaches I know that are various levels of income under $10K/month.

  

And I'm going to make projections of how long it would take each of them individually to make $10K.

  

Then we're gonna see if i can send them on some quests that destroy them.

It's all about the party makeup that creates XP gain boosts.

  

Every action a party takes gives insights to different party members. Sharing those insights results in the XP boost.

Then I'm going to fight the boss battle with the party I assemble. Should be fun to see if it's actually that much easier.

  

But at least I'm having a hell of a time designing these quests.
