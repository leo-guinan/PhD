# Appendix C. Extended Related Work

This appendix expands upon Section 8 by offering deeper historical context, cross‑disciplinary parallels, and an annotated bibliography. It is intended as a launchpad for researchers who wish to position our “recursion‑as‑network” thesis within broader scholarly conversations.

## C.1 Historical Development of Recursion Theory

| Decade | Milestone | Key Figures | Relevance to Networks |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 1930s | Formalization of “effective computation” | Alonzo Church, Alan Turing | Established that *procedure* implies an implicit control network. |
| 1950s | Recursion Theorem & µ‑Recursion | Stephen Kleene | Fixed‑point constructions equate to minimal self‑referential graphs. |
| 1960s–70s | Structural & Primitive Recursion | Rózsa Péter, John McCarthy | Highlighted nesting depth and branching, presaging temporal‑graph metrics. |
| 1980s | Typed λ‑Calculus & Total Functional Languages | Henk Barendregt, David Turner | Introduced termination guarantees that effectively bound network diameter. |
| 2000s | Co‑induction & Corecursion | Thierry Coquand, Venanzio Capretta | Formalized infinite unfoldings—temporal graphs of unbounded diameter. |

### C.1.1 Emerging Trends (2010–Present)
* **Higher‑Inductive Types** (HoTT) treat induction and co‑induction as path constructors—literally edges in a type‑level space.
* **Homotopy‑Type‑Theory Glasses** re‑imagine recursion proofs as *path‑homotopies*, tightening links to network topology.

## C.2 Cross‑Disciplinary Connections

### C.2.1 Physics
* **Renormalization Group** – Recursive coarse‑graining forms hierarchical graphs; diameter corresponds to scale separation.
* **Causal Sets** – Discrete spacetime models built from transitive‑closure of events; recursion depth equates to proper time.

### C.2.2 Biology
* **Embryogenesis** – Recursive gene‑regulatory networks drive development; temporal‑diameter constrains morphogenesis speed.
* **Phylogenetics** – Speciation trees with memoization‑like collapse after mass extinctions.

### C.2.3 Economics & Social Systems
* **Input–Output Models** – Leontief’s recursive matrix inversions create dependency graphs; entropy correlates with systemic fragility.
* **Legal Citation Networks** – Precedent chains behave like memoized recursion: overruled cases prune subtrees, reducing diameter.

### Foundational Works
1. **Church, A.** *An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory.* *American Journal of Mathematics*, 1936. — Introduces λ‑calculus; foundational to recursion definitions.  
2. **Turing, A.** *On Computable Numbers.* *Proc. London Math. Soc.*, 1937. — Turing machine model; establishes universal computation via state transition networks.
3. **Kleene, S.** *Introduction to Metamathematics.* North‑Holland, 1952. — Contains the recursion theorem; underpins our isolation proof.

### Modern Network Perspectives
4. **Holme, P.; Saramäki, J.** *Temporal Networks.* Springer, 2013. — Comprehensive metric toolbox; we adapt diameter & burstiness to call graphs.  
5. **Castro‑Alvarez, A. et al.** *Program Behavior as Temporal Graphs.* *IEEE TSE*, 2021. — Empirical link between temporal patterns and performance; motivates our LLVM probes.

### Cross‑Disciplinary Texts
6. **Whitehead, A. N.** *Process and Reality.* Free Press, 1929. — Process ontology; philosophically buttresses computation‑as‑relation.  
7. **Floridi, L.** *The Philosophy of Information.* Oxford UP, 2010. — Information flow as relational; echoes our network thesis.
8. **Wolfram, S.** *A New Kind of Science.* Wolfram Media, 2002. — Irreducible computation; time emergent from updates, aligning with our temporal view.
9. **Bombelli, L.; Henson, J.** *Causal Sets and the Structure of Spacetime.* *Classical and Quantum Gravity*, 2009. — Spacetime as a partial order; recursion depth analogous to proper time.

### Recommended Surveys
10. **Muthukrishnan, S.** *A Primer on Temporal Graphs.* arXiv 2210.00001, 2022. — Accessible intro; good starting point for CS readership.  
11. **Capretta, V.** *General Recursion via Co‑inductive Types.* *Logical Methods in Computer Science*, 2007. — Formalizes total yet potentially infinite recursion, mapping to unbounded network paths.

## C.4 Further Reading & Open Bibliographic Gaps

* **Quantum Recursion** – Few dedicated texts exist; see recent workshops on quantum co‑induction.
* **Energy Metrics** – Bridging entropy of call graphs to RAPL counters lacks longitudinal studies.
* **Inter‑domain Syntheses** – Comparative analyses of recursion networks in sociology vs. neural circuits remain sparse.

Researchers are encouraged to expand this bibliography as the field evolves, particularly with interdisciplinary case studies that put temporal‑network metrics into practice.
